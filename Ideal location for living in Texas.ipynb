    "Opting for a suitable location to live in a good and a peaceful environment is the most important decision while travelling. A vicinity having all the basic needs of life nearby along with entertaining and recreational areas can be a suitable pick . In Texas, there are a number of motels to live in while travelling but still considering the increase in population and travelling, there is always a need of some good resting place. An ideal location can be one that falls under the budget along the basic necessaties available nearby. Therefore, in this project we will try to find the best location for setting up a motel."
